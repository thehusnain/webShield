**SCAN RESULTS FOR TARGET URL: https://google.com**

**OPEN PORTS:** 
No open ports found

**SAFETY STATUS:** Safe

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**

1. **Verify server settings**: Since no ports are open, it might indicate that the server is not configured to listen on any ports. Verify the server settings to ensure it's correctly configured.
2. **Check firewall rules**: Ensure that the firewall is correctly configured to allow necessary ports for server services. If no ports are open, it might be due to restrictive firewall rules.
3. **Review server services**: Since no ports are open, it's likely that the server is not running any services. Review the server services and configuration to determine why no ports are open.
