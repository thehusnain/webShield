Let me explain the scan results in simple language.

**What Nikto checks:**
Nikto is a tool that checks a website for common security issues. Imagine it's like a security guard who looks around for potential problems on your website.

**What was found:**
In this scan, the security guard (Nikto) didn't find any critical security issues on your website. That's good news!

**Is this dangerous or normal:**
Not finding any issues is normal. It means your website is secure and doesn't have any obvious security problems.

**Simple security advice:**
However, this doesn't mean you're completely safe. Here are some tips to keep your website secure:

1. **Keep your software up-to-date**: Make sure your website's software and plugins are updated with the latest security patches.
2. **Use strong passwords**: Use unique and strong passwords for your website's admin accounts.
