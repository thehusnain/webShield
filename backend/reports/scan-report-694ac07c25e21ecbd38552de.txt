AI EXPLANATION (Simple Language)

**What are Open Ports?**

When a website or computer system is connected to the internet, it uses specific ports to communicate with other systems. Think of ports like different doors in a house. Each door (port) allows a specific type of communication (like mail, phone calls, or visitors).

**What these Open Ports Mean**

In this case, the scan tool "nikto" says that no open ports were found on the target URL (https://spotify.com). This means that Spotify's system is not broadcasting its internal doors (ports) to the internet, which is a good thing!

**Which Ports are Risky**

Risky ports are those that can be exploited by hackers to gain unauthorized access to a system. Commonly vulnerable ports include:

- Port 21 (FTP) - File transfer protocol
- Port 22 (SSH) - Secure shell
- Port 110 (POP3) - Email retrieval
- Port 25 (SMTP) - Email sending

However, since no open ports were found on Spotify's system, it's clear they are not exposing these potentially vulnerable doors to the internet.

**What Should be Closed**

Not applicable in this case, as no open ports were found.

**Simple Recommendations**

- **Regular Security Audits**: Conduct regular security scans like this one to ensure your system's internal doors (ports) are not exposed to the internet.
- **Firewall Configuration**: Review your firewall settings to ensure they are properly blocking all unnecessary ports and communications.
- **Port Management**: Keep track of all your internal doors (ports) and make sure they are only open when necessary.
