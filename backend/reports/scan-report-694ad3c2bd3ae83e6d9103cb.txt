     WEB SECURITY SCAN REPORT
===========================================

SCAN DETAILS:
-------------
Scan ID     : 694ad3c2bd3ae83e6d9103cb
Target URL : https://yasirahmed.tech
Scan Type  : NMAP
Scan Time  : Tue Dec 23 2025 22:39:14 GMT+0500 (Pakistan Standard Time)

===========================================
         AI ANALYSIS REPORT
===========================================

Let's break down the scan results for the given URL.

**1. Open Ports:**
There are no open ports found on the target URL. This means that the nmap scan could not detect any open connections or services running on the server.

**2. Common/Normal Ports:**
Normal ports are usually used for common services like:

- 80 (HTTP): This is the standard port for websites and web servers. It's like the main entrance to the website.
- 443 (HTTPS): This is the secure version of the website, which uses encryption to protect user data.
- 22 (SSH): This port is usually used for secure remote access to a server or computer.

**3. Risky Ports:**
Ports that might be considered risky are those that are often used for less secure services or are commonly targeted by hackers. Some examples include:

- 21 (FTP): This port is used for file transfer protocol, which can be a security risk if not configured properly.
- 23 (Telnet): This port is used for remote access to a server, but it's not as secure as SSH.

**4. Safety of Open Ports:**
Since there are no open ports found, it's safe to say that the target URL is not currently exposing any services that could be vulnerable to attacks.

**5. Security Recommendations:**
Based on the scan results, here are some simple security recommendations:

- Make sure to keep your website and server software up to date, as newer versions often include security patches.
- Use strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication to secure remote access to the server.
- Consider using a web application firewall (WAF) to detect and block malicious traffic.
- Regularly scan your server for vulnerabilities and apply necessary patches.

Remember, security is an ongoing process, and you should always be monitoring and improving your defenses to stay protected.
