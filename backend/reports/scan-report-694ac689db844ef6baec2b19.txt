AI EXPLANATION (Simple Language)
----------------------------------------

Let me explain the results in simple language:

**What are open ports?**

An open port is like a mailbox on your house. You have multiple mailboxes where mail can be delivered. In the case of a website, ports are like those mailboxes where different services (like email, chat, or web browsing) can send and receive information.

**Are the open ports normal or risky?**

In this case, no open ports were found, which is completely normal. Most websites and local networks shouldn't have open ports unless they're specifically designed to have certain services accessible from the internet, like a web server (which is likely the case here since you're running a local development server on port 3000).

**Which ports should stay open?**

If you need a service to be accessible from the internet, like a web server, file sharing, or email, those ports should stay open. For example, port 80 for HTTP or 443 for HTTPS are common open ports for websites.

**Simple security advice:**

To keep your local network secure, you should:

1. Only open ports that are necessary for specific services.
2. Keep your software and services up to date with the latest security patches.
3. Use strong passwords and two-factor authentication (2FA) whenever possible.
4. Be cautious when connecting to the internet from a device on your local network.

In this specific case, since you're running a local development server on port 3000, that's perfectly normal. Just make sure to keep your development environment and software up to date.
